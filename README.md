# ReportCMS

It was created in a couple of hours and as such was not written to be secure. 
It is though written to be non-destructive, the save and load buttons do not
overwrite the version history and therefore don't lose content; backups are
kept.

If you'd like to see the source that produced the page, press LOAD in the 
editor; this will get retrieve the last save.
